## Description

For example, there is a group of people who order food for them every day. They have their favorite restaurants, favorite time to eat, and also they want to order food together, so every day one person orders food for the whole group. Every day someone else from the group orders food. Also, they want to change the restaurant every time they order. This web app optimizes this process.   

## Protoype
The app is simple, you just sign up, add participants of your group, add your favorite restaurants, and set your favorite time to eat. Then just click the button "Make the Order" and the window pops out with information about your order. Then you fill the forms about who is ordering which food and click order. The app also shows you your past orders, favorite restaurant, the average of times you order, and for each participant his favorite food (there is some issue with this function, so in some cases, it could don't work properly). I would implement some other functions if I have more time, such as food recommendations, restaurant recommendations, mouth analyses, and more.

## Presentation

Just my github

## Challenges and accomplishments

I learned a lot of new features in Bootstrap 4, try some new features of Flask, and learned Flask more to deep.

I am proud of this project for finishing it in two days.

## Next steps

I will try to implement the functions I mentioned above, make the program more readable and make the code simple as possible.
